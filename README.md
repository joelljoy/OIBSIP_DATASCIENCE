 Data Science Internship Projects – Oasis Infobyte

This repository contains the projects I completed during my Data Science internship at Oasis Infobyte. These projects demonstrate my understanding of Python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis and Data Visualization.

 Projects Included

 1. Iris Flower Classification
A machine learning classification project that predicts the species of an iris flower based on sepal and petal measurements using Logistic Regression.

 2. Unemployment Analysis
A data analysis project that studies unemployment trends during the COVID-19 period using Python visualization libraries.

 3. Car Price Prediction
A regression-based machine learning model that predicts the selling price of a car using features such as year, present price, kilometers driven and ownership.

 4. Email Spam Detection
A Natural Language Processing project that classifies email messages as spam or ham using text vectorization and a machine learning classifier.

 5. Sales Prediction
A regression model that predicts sales based on advertising expenditure across TV, radio and newspaper platforms.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

These projects helped me gain hands-on experience in real-world data science workflows including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation and visualization.
